# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

**Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/or2ooo/bitbucket-mcp/security/advisories/new) to report vulnerabilities privately. You will receive a response within 72 hours.

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Latest  | Yes       |

Only the latest published version receives security updates.

## Scope

This policy covers the MCP server code in this repository. It does **not** cover:

- Bitbucket Cloud itself (report to [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/trust/security/vulnerability-reporting))
- The Model Context Protocol SDK (report to [@modelcontextprotocol/sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/sdk))
- Your Atlassian API tokens — keep these secret and rotate them regularly
